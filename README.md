# 360-video-blender-addon

After designing a product, it’s always important for the customer to see its 360 video to see from all the sides. In blender we can get 360 turntable animation videos of the object, but the problem is, it’s all manual work. The effort is required in adding camera, moving it in circular path. Circular path must be decided based on objects dimension. Rotation can have different axis of rotation. For each of these axes, the path of camera traverse is different. This add-on takes care of all the hard work that must be done by the user and saves the 360 video by the name specified by user in the directory specified again by user itself.

Objects that must be involved in 360 video must be selected & clicked on ‘objects to centre’. This will bring the objects to the centre which will make scripting part easier will adding the camera. 

In next part, based on view of object specified by user, camera will be added along with additional functionalities such as zooming out or in in the camera at the same time moving object in x & y direction to set it at the centre. 

Additionally, user is provided with an option to change the axis of rotation. Either it can be parallel to screen or perpendicular the screen. Script will change the background of video to white to enhance the quality.

User has to add filename and filepath, click on save animation. It will take a minute or so to get the video saved to the local disc.
